This project focuses on designing and creating a Python program that generates and prints groups of faces using functions that return or print strings. The assignment helps you practice core programming concepts like function definitions, function calls, helper functions, handling parameters, returning values, and string manipulation. I also used Pythonâ€™s random module to introduce variability in the output.
